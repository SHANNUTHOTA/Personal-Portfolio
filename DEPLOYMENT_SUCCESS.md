## ✨ Contributor Status

**Before:** 2 contributors (lovable-dev[bot] + you)
**After:** 1 contributor (YOU ONLY! 🎯)

The commit history has been completely rewritten with a fresh, clean initial commit authored entirely by you.

## 🎯 What Happens Next?

GitHub will update the contributor information within a few minutes to a few hours. The bot will no longer appear as a contributor once GitHub's cache refreshes.

If you still see the bot after 24 hours:
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Check the "Manage access" section
3. Make sure only you have access

## 🚀 Final Notes

Your portfolio is now:
- ✅ Live and accessible worldwide

- ✅ Ready to share with recruiters!
